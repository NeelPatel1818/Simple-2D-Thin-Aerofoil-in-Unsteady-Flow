# Simple-2D-Thin-Aerofoil-in-Unsteady-Flow
Aim: - Simple 2D-Thin Aerofoil in Unsteady Flow Modelled using Lumped Vortex Elements.

Note: -
I had taken help from online code which is cited as below from which I modified the formatting and necessary parameter values and obtained my results.

Alexander Giles (2023). _Simple unsteady vortex code to demonstrate wake rollup_ (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53119-simple-unsteady-vortex-code-to-demonstrate-wake-rollup), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved April 20, 2023.

Results: -

-->I have compared X component chord vs Z component chord using the different Vx (Velocity of X-Component) at iterative Time Step.

-->It was observed that the results from the Plot defines that as we increase our Velocity, we got a fine domain of Air flow. It signifies that we got less eddy current      formation for our air flow @Vx=150 and Time Step=820.

-->As per fluid mechanics concept lesser the eddy formation less will be our resistive or Drag pressure fields i.e. Drag force will be less.
